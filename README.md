# Delay Print
Inspired by [Octoprint Procrastinator](https://github.com/juergenpabel/OctoPrint-Procastinator)

Delays the start of a print to a given time, does not lock the printer up until the scheduled print. If a print is already running when the scheduled start time is reached, the scheduled print will not be run.
If the server is shutdown/restarted, scheduled jobs will be lost.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
